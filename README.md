# MCQG-SRefine.py_re-implement
Re-implementation of **"MCQG-SRefine"**
> **Disclaimer:** This is *not* the official implementation.  

This repository contains a Python-based re-implementation of the **MCQG-SRefine** model, originally proposed in the paper:
* \[arXiv] [**MCQG-SRefine: Multiple Choice Question Generation and Evaluation with Iterative Self-Critique, Correction, and Comparison Feedback**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13191)

The main objective of this project is to **explore LLM-based approaches** for automatic generation of **medical multiple-choice questions (MCQs)**.

This includes:

* **Question generation** – Creating high-quality medical MCQs using large language models.
* **Answer generation** – Producing correct answers along with detailed explanations.
* **Question evaluation** – Assessing correctness, difficulty, and discrimination indices.
* **Question refinement** – Iteratively improving questions based on evaluation feedback.
