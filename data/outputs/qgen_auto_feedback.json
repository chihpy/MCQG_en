She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ). Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary. Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected. Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month. A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration. The pathological diagnosis revealed that the removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a). At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted. Postoperative CT examination has not yet been performed.",

     "reasoning": "The patient's bladder lesion is described as a 2-cm stalked papillary tumor located on the posterior bladder wall, which was resected transurethrally. Pathology confirmed a non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (stage 0a). This type of tumor typically presents as a papillary growth confined to the urothelium without invasion into the muscularis propria, consistent with the clinical and pathological findings. The absence of muscle invasion and the use of intravesical chemotherapy further support this diagnosis. Other options are less consistent: Small cell carcinoma (A) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine tumor usually presenting as a bulky invasive mass; adenocarcinoma (B) and squamous cell carcinoma (C) are less common bladder cancers often associated with chronic irritation or metaplasia and tend to be invasive; muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (D) involves deeper bladder wall layers and would not be classified as stage 0a; metastatic ovarian carcinoma (E) would be unlikely without a known primary ovarian tumor and typically presents differently. Therefore, the diagnosis of non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (stage 0a) best fits the clinical, imaging, and pathological data.",

She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ). Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary. Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected. Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month. A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration. The pathological diagnosis revealed that the removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a). At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted. Postoperative CT examination has not yet been performed.",
