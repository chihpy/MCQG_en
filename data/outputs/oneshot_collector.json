She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ). Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary. Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected. Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month. A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration. The pathological diagnosis revealed that the removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a). At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted. Postoperative CT examination has not yet been performed.",

Cystoscopy allows direct visualization of the bladder mucosa, enabling identification, localization, and biopsy or resection of suspicious lesions.

Intravenous pyelogram (A) is primarily used to evaluate the upper urinary tract and is not the best initial test for bladder lesions.

Abdominal MRI without cystoscopic evaluation (C) may provide additional imaging detail but cannot replace direct visualization and tissue diagnosis.

  "reasoning": "The patient has a vascularized mass within the bladder mucosa detected by transvaginal ultrasound, and urine cytology shows atypical cells suspicious for malignancy. Although she is asymptomatic and urinalysis is negative for hematuria, the presence of atypical cells warrants direct visualization and tissue diagnosis. Cystoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating bladder lesions because it allows direct inspection of the bladder mucosa and enables biopsy of suspicious areas for histopathological confirmation. Intravenous pyelogram (A) is primarily used to evaluate the upper urinary tract and is less sensitive for bladder lesions. Abdominal MRI (B) can provide imaging details but cannot replace direct visualization and biopsy. Repeat ultrasound in 3 months (C) delays diagnosis and treatment. Urine culture and sensitivity (E) are useful for infection but do not diagnose malignancy. Therefore, cystoscopy is the most appropriate next step.",
