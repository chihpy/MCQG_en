  "context": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass.",
  "question": "Which of the following best describes this mass?",
  "options": "(A)Granulosa tumor (B)Ovarian carcinoid (C)Sertoli-Leydig tumor (D)Teratoma (E)Thecoma",
  "correct_answer": "Sertoli-Leydig tumor",
  "reasoning": "The patient's presentation of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement strongly suggests an underlying excess of androgens, leading to masculinization. This observation is further supported by her irregular menstrual cycles and elevated serum testosterone levels, indicative of a hormone-related issue. The discovery of a sizable 12-cm ovarian mass through ultrasonography provides a crucial clue, suggesting an ovarian origin for the hormone imbalance. Importantly, the normal serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and urinary 17-ketosteroids effectively rule out adrenal and widespread androgen sources as the primary cause. Among the diagnostic possibilities, a Sertoli-Leydig tumor (C) stands out due to its potential to produce excess androgens, which aligns perfectly with the patient's clinical and hormonal profile. This tumor is a plausible explanation for the observed masculinizing features, irregular menstrual cycles, and elevated serum testosterone. Conversely, other options such as granulosa tumor, ovarian carcinoid, teratoma, and thecoma are less congruent with the predominant androgenic presentation and hormone profile of the patient."

  "context": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22â€“198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L.",
  "question": "Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?",
  "options": "(A)The patient has a 50% risk for developing DMD (B)The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD  (C)The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD (D)The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration (E)The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation",
  "correct_answer": "The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation",
  "reasoning": "The patient seeks genetic counseling due to a familial history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), inherited in an X-linked manner. Her brother and maternal uncle had DMD, implying a genetic connection. While her mother's elevated muscle creatine kinase (CK) levels suggest carrier status, the patient's normal CK levels can't definitively confirm her carrier status. This uncertainty arises from random X chromosome inactivation, causing variable gene expression. Thus, due to the intricate interplay of X-linked inheritance and random X inactivation, the patient's DMD carrier status remains uncertain. This comprehensive view dispels simpler options based solely on CK levels or family history, emphasizing the complex nature of assessing X-linked carrier status."

  "context": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of mild nausea, increased urinary urgency and frequency, and constipation. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.",
  "question": "Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?",
  "options": "(A)Inactivation of cellular p53 (B)Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes (C)Specialized transduction  (D)Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX  (E)Translocation of CMYC to an Ig gene promoter",
  "correct_answer": "Inactivation of cellular p53",
  "reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, characterized by weight loss, vaginal bleeding, and a palpable rock-hard pelvic mass with nodular cervix and irregular vaginal wall, points towards an advanced case of squamous cell carcinoma. The biopsy results confirm well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. In this context, the most likely pathogenesis is the inactivation of cellular p53, which serves as a pivotal tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause squamous cell carcinoma through its insertion into host DNA, producing viral proteins that bind to cellular p53, thereby inhibiting its pro-apoptotic function. This inactivation allows for unchecked cell growth and contributes to the development of cervical cancer. Other options can be ruled out: B (viral promoters) applies to oncogene activation by viral insertion, not squamous cell carcinoma. C (specialized transduction) pertains to gene transfer mechanisms, not relevant here. D (TAX transactivation) involves HIV and HTLV, not squamous cell carcinoma. E (c-myc translocation) is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, not the patient's cervical carcinoma."
